        <h3>Coping with stress</h3>
        <p>With projects, labs, homework, and those skipped lectures piling up, it is very easy to get swallowed up by the stress of CS classes. Aside from dedicating a few caffinated nights to that imminent project (or start earlier), seek help from a friend, and managing your time, there are many places on campus to have someone help you detangle your life and cope with stress.</p>

Sweat out your stress so you can work better! Check out these places for some workout inspirations.

        <h3>Eating</h3>
        <p>Are you glancing at that stash of Ramen in your closet? There’s no guilt unless they are the only form of food you intake nowadays. Try to eat healthy can be hard without the time or energy to cook or search for good food, and they can sometimes be expensive. However, there are resources on campus to help deal with that!</p>

        <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>A CS friend once observed: the bedtime for CS-ers is the due time for projects. But late nights and coffee should not be your best friends.</p>
